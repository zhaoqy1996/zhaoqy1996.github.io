This is a project thaat I particpated in as an undergraduate research assistant in Prof. Zhenli Xu's lab. In this work we develop a fast meshless algorithm for electrostatic interaction in an irregular domain with given potential boundary conditions, which is of importance in many applications such as electrochemical energy and electric structure calculations.
